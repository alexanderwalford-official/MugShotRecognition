# MugShotRecognition
This project is entirely opensource and has been developed to be used in a university PHD research project voluntarily. The system is pretty much entirely autonomous and allows the user to define specific parameters such as the hashing method, the number of images to use and the number of images to blur. There are also other various settings that can be used to configure the application appropriately. Please note that this application / project has had very little bug testing and is quite likely to crash. I intend to update this application in the near future.
